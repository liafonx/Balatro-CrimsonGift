# CrimsonGift

[中文说明](README_zh.md)

**Crimson's Gift** — When Crimson Heart disables a hand-size Joker, your run gains a permanent hand size increase. It is intentional, powerful, and built for endless runs.

## Why This Mod Exists

SMODS `1.0.0~BETA-1221a` and later fixed the vanilla Crimson Heart hand-size bug. This mod restores that behavior as an intentional, balanced mechanic.

## How It Works

- Disabling a hand-size Joker grants a **pending +N**
- The increase is applied **after play another hand**
- **If that hand defeats the boss, the gift is lost**

## Example

1. You have Juggler (+1 hand size) → hand size is `9/9`
2. Crimson Heart disables Juggler → display becomes `9/9` (normaly should be 9/8)
3. You finish the hand → permanent hand size becomes `10/10`
4. If that same hand defeats the boss → the gift is **lost**

## Requirements&Compatibility

- **SMODS and Lovely is required** (no vanilla support)
- **Minimum SMODS version:** `1.0.0~BETA-1221a`
- ✅ Compatible with other hand-size mods (does not overwrite SMODS logic)
- ❌ Vanilla-only (If Balatro fixes bug in later veriion, compatibility will be taken into consideration.)

## Strategy Tips

In endless runs, we often use the combination of Baron, Mime, and red-seal Steel Kings to tackle the climb. That core scales best with larger hands, so hand size and Joker slots quickly become limiting factors. Negative Jokers are rare, so players often rely on Ectoplasm to add Negative to existing Jokers—but Ectoplasm also reduces hand size. Crimson Gift offsets that penalty, allowing you to take more Ectoplasm rolls without shrinking your hand size so much that you lose the game. Because viable endless seeds are rare and long runs can take hours, a single hand-size bottleneck can ruin a run; Crimson Gift slightly improves the odds without breaking balance.
